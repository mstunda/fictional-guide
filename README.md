# About
The interface is built using Python 3.7 and the TkInter library. 

The user has access to two sliders:
- The (internally regulated) quadrature component of the stator current
- The (externally enforced) actual rotor speed.

The output vector diagram and operational quadrant diagram only represent steady state operation in the base speed range.
